Docker Images:

# docker images  [check all images]

# docker pull image_name  [to pull images]

# docker rmi image_name   [ to remove image]


Docker RUN :

# docker run image_name  [to run a container of latest image version]

# docker run image_name:tag 	[to run a container with specific version]

# docker run image_name sleep 50 [ run a image for 50 seconds ]

# docker run -it centos bash  [ to run image and go to the bash of that image] [ -i is for interactive mode and -t for terminal ]

# docker run python cat /etc/*release*   [ to check the os version of the image ]

# docker run -d image_name  [ run a container in detached mood or background]

# docker attach container-id-or-name [ to attach a container again from detached mode]

# docker run --name webapp nginx:1.14-alpine      [ run a container with a name webapp using the image nginx:1.14-alpine ]

# docker run -p 80:5000 webapp    [ PORT mapping: 80 is mapped port. 5000 is default port . out side container will access through 80 port]

# docker run -v /opt/databack:/var/lib/mysql mysql [ Volume mapping : mapped a external volume /opt/databack to container volume /var/lib/mysql] [ if we delete container then data will not lost]

# docker run -e APP_COLOR=blue simple-webapp-color [ e= environment variable, to check it- inspect the image and see environment variable is set or not ]

Q-1 Run a container named blue-app using image kodekloud/simple-webapp and set the environment variable APP_COLOR to blue. Make the application available on port 38282 on the host. The application listens on port 8080.

# docker run --name blue-app -p 38282:8080 -e APP_COLOR=blue kodekloud/simple-webapp 

Q-2 Deploy a mysql database using the mysql image and name it mysql-db. Set the database password to use db_pass123. Lookup the mysql image on Docker Hub and identify the correct environment variable to use for setting the root password. Name: mysql-db , Image: mysql, Env: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=db_pass123

# docker run --name mysql-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=db_pass123 -d mysql

Docker container:

# docker ps    [check running container]

# docker ps -a   [ check all container]

# docker inspect container-id-or-name  [ detail information in json format ]

# docker stop container-id-or-name    [ to stop a container]

# docker rm container-id-or-name   [to remove a container]

# docker exec container-id-or-name cat /etc/*release*   [execute a command into the container]

# docker logs container-id-or-name   [to read log of a container]
